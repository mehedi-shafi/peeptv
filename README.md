# An online service for scrapping streamable link from TV.us

I have made a bit of modification of the code made by [scwifty](https://github.com/schwifty42069/piptv/). The purpose of the modification is to keep this hosted on a server or something like a raspberry pi in the home and simply use this as a api for app on any other device. And most importantly to have the call done not from the personal device. Like a proxy server. LOL. 

I use a simple script for running it on my PC by fetching the stream url from a proxy server hosted somewhere else.
